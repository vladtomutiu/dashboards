library(janitor)

penguins <- read_csv("data/penguins_Iter.csv")

penguins <- penguins %>%
  clean_names()

```

Instructions: Make a dashboard with two rows. Row 1 should contain two graphs showing any penguin data you'd like. Row two should contain a table (use knitr::kable and select if you'd like to narrow down the columns). Then customize your dashboard by adding colors, labels, interactivity, etc.

Optional: Add text cards, value boxes, tabs, pages, etc.
