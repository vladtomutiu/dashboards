HOW NBA PLAYER ROLES AND SCORING TRENDS SHAPE OUTPUT

The 2023 NBA season dataset used can be found at <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirhosseinmirzaie/nba-players-stats2023-season/code>

The dataset has every NBA player from the 2023 season, filtered to include only players that played enough to not create outliars . The data includes player names, positions, age, games played, and statistics like points, rebounds, assists, field goal percentage, and +/-. I made visualizations to answer the questions below:

-   Does NBA players efficiency correlate to scoring output?

<!-- -->

-   Does NBA players +/- (the point differential (points scored minus points allowed) for a team while a specific player is on the court) correlate based on how good of a scorer the player is?

-   Do player positions affect their contribution to specific stats and their overall role on the team?
