```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(janitor)

penguins <- read_csv("data/penguins_lter.csv")

penguins <- penguins %>%
  clean_names()

```

Instructions: Make a dashboard with two rows. Row 1 should contain two graphs showing any penguin data you'd like. Row two should contain a table (use knitr::kable and select if you'd like to narrow down the columns). Then customize your dashboard by adding colors, labels, interactivity, etc.

Optional: Add text cards, value boxes, tabs, pages, etc.

## Row 1

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(culmen_length_mm, island)) +
         geom_boxplot()
         
```

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Row 2

```{r}
penguins <- penguins %>%
  select(-comments)

knitr::kable(penguins)
```
